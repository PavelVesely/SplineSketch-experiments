# SplineSketch-experiments
SplineSketch: a new quantile sketch with uniform error guarantees and high accuracy. Here, we provide its prototype implementation and experimental evaluation

Note: This repository accompanies a paper under submission that we will make available in about 3 months. The SplineSketch implementation is intended to perform accuracy and running time experiments; it is thus to some extent under development and may change. A SplineSketch version that is suitable for usage in production will appear later in a different repository.

WIP: will add prototypes in Python and Java, and experimental pipeline
